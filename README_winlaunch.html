<h1>winlaunch -- a utility for making it easier to run Windows GUI applications from the Cygwin prompt</h1>

Version 0.2c, February 2015.

<h3>The problem</h3>

Cygwin provides a Unix-like command line interface on Microsoft Windows
platforms. Those of us who are used to working with the command line
frequently find such a way of working preferable to the use of graphical tools.
A large number of GNU/Linux utilities have been ported to Cygwin, but
there are inevitably problems integrating the command line with native
Windows applications. It would be nice, for example, to open firefox
to view an HTML file like this:

<pre>
$ firefox /docs/something.html 
</pre>

Or, perhaps, to launch the SMPlayer media player like this:

<pre>
$ smplayer /media/music/something/*.mp3
</pre>


It is certainly possible to launch native Windows
applications from the Cygwin prompt, but there are two immediate problems.
<p/>
First, the installation directories of most Windows applications are not 
usually listed on the $PATH seen by Cygwin. This problem is easy to 
overcome by either making a symbolic link from the program's installation
directory to (say) <code>/usr/bin</code>, or by implementing a script
in <code>/usr/bin</code>
<p/>
The second problem is much less tractable: native Windows filename formats
are different from those used by Unix. Moreover, Cygwin has its own file
naming conventions (e.g., <code>c:\foo.bat</code> is typically 
<code>/cygdrive/c/foo.bat</code>). Cygwin provides a file mapping utility
<code>cygpath</code> to address this problem. So I could, in principle,
launch firefox with a particular file like this:

<pre>
$ firefox `cygpath -w /docs/something.html` 
</pre>

Not only is this ugly, it is prone to fail when the command line argument 
contains wildcards (e.g., <code>*.mp3</code>). <code>Cygpath</code> will 
expand wildcards, but if the path contains spaces, the output will be 
completely garbled -- the spaces between arguments become indistinguishable
from the spaces in the paths. 
<p/>
Although the 
facility is rarely used directly, many Windows applications do accept
filenames as command-line arguments, and if you mostly work at the 
command line, it makes sense to be able to run Windows applications this
way where appropriate. <code>winlaunch</code> is a simple utility to make this task
a bit easier. It is primarily intended to be used within shell scripts, but
it can be invoked directly on the command line. One reason for invoking it
directly is to invoke the Windows default handler for a file, rather than
specifying an application. For example
<pre>
$ winlaunch /home/fred/myfile.txt
</pre>
<p/>
will attempt to launch the default 'open' handler for files with extension
<code>.txt</code> -- typically Notepad or Write, unless you've specified
a different one.
<p/>
I would have thought that Cygwin would have some built-in utility for
simplifying the launching of Windows applications that take filename
arguments but, so far as I can tell, it does not. 


<h3>How winlaunch (sometimes) solves the problem</h3>

What is required is a utility that can iterate over the list of
arguments supplied on the command line and, for each one that looks
like a filename, convert it into Windows format. This utility can then
be called in a script to launch the native Windows application with
Windows-format filenames.
For example, on my system a script to launch OpenOffice with an (optional)
list of files looks like this:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
winlaunch "/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/OpenOffice.org 3/program/soffice.exe" "$@"
</pre>

This script is saved as <code>/usr/bin/ooffice</code>.
<p/>
Note that the first argument to <code>winlaunch</code> is the Windows binary,
in Cygwin format, not Windows format. The script takes a list of arguments
which are also in Cygwin format. The script would be run like this:

<pre>
$ ooffice /home/fred/docs/test.odt 
</pre>

It will also work correctly with wildcards, because the Cygwin shell expands
the wildcards and supplies the full list of arguments to <code>winlaunch</code>.
<p/>
Of course, not all arguments supplied to an application will be filenames.
An approach like the one adopted by <code>winlaunch</code> only works to
the extent that it is possible to distinguish filenames from other
things. Fortunately, most arguments supplied to Windows applications are
like to be filenames. Situations in which the <code>winlaunch</code> 
approach will fail are 
discussed below.

<h3>winlaunch implementation</h3>

<code>winlauch</code> could probably be cooked up as a shell script or a
perl script. The problem here is the handling of spaces and special
characters in filenames. The utility would need to spawn a shell to
run the actual application and, if there are spaces in the pathname
(and there usually are, with Windows applications), the correct
escaping and quoting would need to be applied. That's surprisingly
troublesome in an application like this -- certainly beyond my shell
hacking skills. So I have implemented <code>winlaunch</code> in C.
It's relatively short -- under 200 lines of code -- because the hard
work is done by invoking the Cygwin API to do the actual filename
conversions. Using C means we can use <code>exec()</code>
to launch the application with an array of strings as arguments. This
avoids all the hassle with escaping spaces and what-nots that plague
shell and perl scripts. <code>winlaunch</code> can also use the Windows
API function <code>ShellExecute</code> to invoke applications, and it is
this that gives it the ability to launch a document, rather than an
executable. This feature will be described in more detail below. 

<p/>
The source code, and binary, are available at the links given at the
end of this page. 


<h3>How winlaunch (sometimes) doesn't solve the problem</h3>

The harsh reality is that <code>winlaunch</code> is trying to solve an
intractable problem -- there is simply no way for a general-purpose utility
to distinguish filenames from non-filenames. Some Windows utilities 
use '/' as a switch character, much as Unix uses '-' or '--'. 
<code>winlaunch</code> simply has no way to distinguish a
command line switch '/help' from a file called '/help'. It might seem that
a simple solution is to see if the argument corresponds to a file that
exists on the system but that, too, will fail -- some utilities 
legitimately take as input filenames that don't have corresponding files.
For example, to run <code>lame</code> to convert a WAV file to MP3, I
might want to do:

<pre>
$ lame /path/to/something.wav /path/to/something.mp3
</pre>

The file <code>something.mp3</code> need not exist, but if we don't 
convert the pathname we end up with something that makes no sense to the
(Windows) <code>lame</code> utility. The same problem potentially 
affects many other applications.
<p/>
<code>winlaunch</code> will aggressively convert filenames -- so long
as something looks like it might be a filename, it gets converted. This
seems to me to be the right approach because, if I'm launching a Windows
application from the command line, most likely the arguments are filenames.
There are two exceptions. First, an argument that starts with a '-' will
not be converted, as this will 
rarely be a filename. 
An attempt
to perform such a conversion would most likely fail anyway because, when
command line arguments do references filenames 
(e.g., <code>-outfile=out.txt</code>) there is no generic way to extrace the
filename component from the rest of the argument. Second, any argument
that contains '//' is assumed to be a URL, and not converted. 
<p/>
Another failure case, which seems unlikely to arise in practice, is the
use of unexpanded wildcards as arguments. Some programs do their own
wildcard expansion, and expect the command-line to supply the wildcards
intact. A common example is the unix <code>find</code> utility:

<pre>
$ find . -name "*.mp3"
</pre>

The use of the double-quotes here is to <i>prevent</i> the shell expanding
the wildcard, which <code>find</code> handles internally. I suspect that
such a problem is unlikely to arise in practice with Windows applications.

<p/>
A further complication is the use of arguments  
that are lists of files separated by (typically) colons. In these
cases, it is usually necessary to modify the separator as well, which
creates additional complications.
<p/>
A problem, unrelated to filenames, is the use of <code>winlaunch</code>
to run Windows console applications. This is perfectly possible, and
<code>winlaunch</code> will do filename conversions if appropriate, but
Windows console applications do not always play nicely with the 
Cygwin terminal. That isn't a limitation of <code>winlaunch</code>, but
<code>winlaunch</code> does expose a problem which might otherwise not
be noticed.
<p/>
A further complication is that the Cygwin shell will favour
executables in the Windows and Windows\System directories over its
own $PATH. You might want to write a script to launch, say, <code>notepad</code>
at the prompt, but you won't be able to call it <code>notepad</code>,
because the original <code>notepad</code> is in the Windows directory and
will be run in preference to the script.

<h3>winlauch and the Windows ShellExecute API</h3>

As of version 0.2a, <code>winlaunch</code> will invoke the Windows API
function <code>ShellExecute</code> if passed an argument that is 
<i>not</i> an executable file. It can also do this for executables if
you force it (see the description of the <code>--windows</code> switch
below).
<p/>
The use of this API makes it possible to launch document files as well
as executables, by having Windows execute the registered hander for that
file type. Which registered handler is used depends on the file extension
and the selected operation. For example, it is possible (sometimes) to
print a document file directly from the command line by doing:

<pre>
$ winluanch --print /path/to/document.pdf
</pre> 

Without the <code>--print</code> switch, the default 'open' handler would
be invoked. 
<p/>
How particular file types are handled is entirely a matter of Windows
configuration -- all <code>winlaunch</code> does is convert filenames and
invoke 
<code>ShellExecute</code>. If there is no handler for a particular operation
on a particular file type, the result might be an error message; it might
equally be a silent failure.
<p/>
Note that Windows file associations work entirely on filename extension.
<code>--print</code> might work on a file whose name ends in <code>.txt</code>,
but fail on a file whose name ends in <code>.c</code>, even though both
files contain plain text. This, again, is a limitation of the Windows
shell.


<h3>winlaunch command line</h3>

The general format of the command line is:

<pre>
winlaunch [options] {executable} {arguments}
</pre>

Any switch options given to <code>winlaunch</code> must come before the
executable -- any that come after are just passed to the executable as its
own switches. So, for example:

<pre>
$winlaunch --debug /path/to/program.exe
</pre>

launches <code>program.exe</code> with <code>winluanch</code> in debug mode.

<pre>
$winlaunch /path/to/program.exe --debug
</pre>

launches <code>program.exe</code>, passing it '--debug' as a command-line
switch. 

<p/>
<i>-d, --debug</i><br/>
Enables debug mode. In this mode, <code>winlaunch</code> prints information
about the filename conversions it is doing, and what is being passed to
API calls. 
<p/> 

<i>-e, --explore</i><br/>
Invokes Windows explorer. This option is only meaningful if the next argument
is a directory name and, since opening explorer is the default action for
directories, specifying <code>--explore</code> is rarely going to be necessary.
<p/>

<i>-f, --find</i><br/>
Invokes the Windows shell search dialog. As with <code>--explore</code>, 
this option is only meaningful if the next argument
is a directory name.
<p/>

<i>--longhelp</i><br/>
Prints some usage information.
<p/>

<i>-o, --open</i><br/>
Invokes Windows default 'open' action on the file specific in the 
next argument. 
<p/>

<i>-m, --minimize</i><br/>
Runs the application with its main window minimized. This option is
only meaningful when the Windows <code>ShellExecute</code> API is used
to launch the executable (see <code>--windows</code>).
<p/>

<i>-p, --print</i><br/>
Invokes Windows default 'print' action on the file specified in the next 
argument. This action 
will only succeed if there is an application registered to print files
wth filename extensions matching the specified argument. 
<p/>

<i>-t, --edit</i><br/>
Invokes Windows default 'edit' action on the file specified in the next 
argument. This action 
will only succeed if there is an application registered to edit files
wth filename extensions matching the specified argument. In practice,
the 'open' action and 'edit' action are usually handled by the same action,
so specifying <code>--edit</code> explicitly is rarely necessary. 
<p/>

<i>-v, --version</i><br/>
Show the version of <code>winlaunch</code> and exit
<p/>

<i>-w, --windows</i><br/>
Forces <code>winlaunch</code> to use the Windows <code>ShellExecute</code>
API rather than the standard <code>exec()</code> call. This API is always
used when the argument to <code>winlaunch</code> is not a binary 
executable. The <code>ShellExecute</code> API is slower, and more
prone to problems involving spaces in filenames, than the use of
<code>exec()</code>. However, specifying <code>--windows</code> does
provide some additional control over how the executable is run, 
such as the ability to run in a minimized window. 

<p/>


<h3>Installation</h3>

WinLaunch is available for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Cygwin, and
most likely only the correct version will work. To install, 
just copy <code>winlaunch.exe</code> or <code>winlaunch64.exe</code>
to <code>/usr/bin</code>.
A simple Makefile is provided in the source bundle, to rebuild the
utility using <code>gcc</code>. Please note that the Makefile line
<code>CFLAGS=-DWIN64</code> must be commented out to build the 32-bit version,
even on a 32-bit system.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<i>Use of rundll32</i><br/>
<code>winlaunch</code> can be used to launch DLL functions that take
filename arguments, via <code>rundll32.exe</code>. For example,
here is a script to launch the Windows photo viewer with a filename:

<pre>
winlaunch "/cygdrive/c/Windows/System32/rundll32.exe" "shimgvw.dll,ImageView_Fullscreen" "$@"
</pre>
<p/>

<i>Synchronous and asynchronous launching</i><br/>
<code>winlaunch</code> will launch Windows utilities synchronously, as would
be standard practice when running a graphical application from the 
prompt on a Unix system. To get the prompt back straight away, use
'&amp;', either on your command line or in a script. An apparent
exception to this principle arises for some Windows applications that
prevent multiple instances being spawned, as is quite common in Windows
programming. If the application simply interacts with an existing instance
of that application, and then quits, this creates the illusion that it is
being launched asynchronously.
<p/>

<i>Windows applications never intended to be run at the prompt</i><br/>
Some Windows applications generate a lot of output to <code>stdout</code>
and <code>stderr</code>, in the expectation that uses will not see it,
because Windows applications are rarely run from a prompt.
You might need to redirect <code>stdout</code> and/or <code>stderr</code>
in your scripts to tame this verbosity.
<p/>

<i>Implicit quoting of arguments to Windows applications</i><br/>
When using the Windows API to run and executable (see <code>--windows</code>)
all arguments are silently expanded to begin and end with double-quotes.
This is essential because the Windows API call takes its arguments as
one long string and, if any arguments contain spaces, not quoting the
arguments would lead to their being split up. This quoting process should
have no user-visible side-effects.
<p/>

<i>Misleading error messages</i><br/>
When using the Windows API to open document files, error reporting is only 
as good as Windows provides. The message 'No association defined' indicates 
a number of different error conditions, such as trying to use
<code>--print</code> on a document type for which there is no print
handler. 'Access denied' nearly always indicates a problem that is
<i>not</i> related to file permissions. In fact, this error is commonly
returned for no apparent reason (a problem which is widely discussed
on Windows programming forums, and which is not fully understood).  
<p/>

<i>Working directory issues</i><br/>
<code>winlaunch</code> does not change the working directory when launching
and executable. If it did, then any filenames specified on the command-line
would have to be absolute, as they would not be locatable as relative
paths once the directory is changed.
<p/>
A few Windows applications need to be launched with a specific working
directory, and do not work with <code>winlaunch</code> very cleanly.
<p/>

<h3>Legal stuff</h3>

<code>winlaunch</code> is distributed according to the terms of the
GNU Public Licence, version 2 -- free of charge and without warranty --
in the hope that it will be useful. Essentially, you should feel free to 
do with it whatever you see fit, other than claiming it as your own work.
